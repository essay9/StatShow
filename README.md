Created a basic scouting tool to easily identify good/most efficient attackers in the Premier League by using a spyder chart / radar graph to visualize the data. I used data from https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2022-2023/shooting/2022-2023-Premier-League-Stats
Currently looking to add more positions such as goalkeepers and defenders to the DB and looking to fix the UI.
