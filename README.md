Created a basic scouting tool to easily identify good/most efficient attackers in the Premier League by using a spyder chart / radar graph to visualize the data. I used data from https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2022-2023/shooting/2022-2023-Premier-League-Stats. Also, imported the spyder chart (radar chart) from https://playground.anychart.com/gallery/src/Radar_Charts_(Spiderweb)/Starter_Pokemon_Comparisom.
Currently looking to add more positions such as goalkeepers and defenders to the DB and looking to fix the UI.

Unprofessional stats report from a a fan:
Lets start off with what we know about Erling Haaland: Plays for the best team in the league(won the treble that season), is a tall physical presence, and is coming off of a very successful season in the Bundesliga and Champions League.
Let's first look at his xG, xG is a complex stat that takes place in the oppositions box (where the goalkeeper is located), the "easier" the shot the higher the xG is (since those are the shots that the player is suppose to score). Now, we compare his xG to the amount of goals he scored, his xG was 28.4 and his goals scored was 36. We see here that he overpreformed his xG and from the research that I did, that could mean many things, lets look at one that stood out.
1) He played for a good team and since he is a lethal striker he was given more opportunities to score.
   
This could be true as the quality of players around him is very high and also the tactics deployed by the manager could also help him recieve more balls and shoot more often. We can also use his shots stat to back this up as he had the 3rd most shots in the league.
